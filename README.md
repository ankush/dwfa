	- Document API - https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/document
	- Frappe Framework basics: https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics and https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes
- There are many vulnerabilities in this code with varying level of complexity for exploits and domain knowledge requirements.
- Technologies you should be familiar with: Python, JS, SQL(specifically MySQL flavour), Jinja2.
- Read docs or better yet, read code if you want to truly understand how something works and how it can be abused. All our code is open source.
